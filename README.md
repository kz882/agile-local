Here is an article called [‘Developers’ lives matter’ – Chinese software engineers use Github to protest against the country’s 996 work schedule](https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3003691/developers-lives-matter-chinese-software-engineers-use-github)

Comment: 
Whereas US labor law seems to be executed very well, in China working after-hours is very common in tech companies and the developers don't get paid for extra work. 996 icu means that working from 9am to 9 pm, 6 days a week makes people end up in the *intensive care unit*, equivalent to *emergency room* in the US. The term seems interesting to me (tho it's illegal to force employees to work overhours for free) because only 3 dits and 3 characters include the whole working environment of the tech companies in China.

One of my friend is considering in China quitting his current job as an AI developer and go to grad school in the US. While **1 million RMB (130k USD)** of tuition and fees seems to cost a great fortune, he deems it worthwhile because he values work-life balance and a higher package here. However, recently an employee in FaceBook commited suicide in the Menlo Park campus. It seems that working for a FLAG company should not be the end of story (pun intended).
>>>>>>> initial commit

I found this article to be pretty interesting because I never thought of Github as a platform for awareness of a particular topic. I had previously 
read about 996 culture being endorsed by Alibaba's Jack Ma, and the staunch defensive stance he took on the topic. But, this method of using Github
to get the word out about these practices seems like it would be more effective than media coverage because 
1. These are first hand accounts of people part of the 996 system.
2. They are sharing their experiences with people from a similar background i.e from a tech-related field. The viewers would be able to relate a lot 
more in this case, and I would assume that the probability of some sort of action or speaking out against it would be higher, than if these experiences
were just published to a more generalised platform such as those on mass media.
Even though several Chinese companies are at the forefront of research in areas such as artificial intelligence and networks (such as 5G technology), 
this system might prove to be detrimental in the long run especially if their workers experience burnout and cannot have stable personal lives. This would
not be in the best interests of either the company or the individuals, so at the end of the day, no one really wins.
