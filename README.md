Here is an article called [‘Developers’ lives matter’ – Chinese software engineers use Github to protest against the country’s 996 work schedule](https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3003691/developers-lives-matter-chinese-software-engineers-use-github)

##Comment: 
Whereas US labor law seems to be executed very well, in China working after-hours is very common in tech companies and the developers don't get paid for extra work. 996 icu means that working from 9am to 9 pm, 6 days a week makes people end up in the *intensive care unit*, equivalent to *emergency room* in the US. The term seems interesting to me (tho it's illegal to force employees to work overhours for free) because only 3 dits and 3 characters include the whole working environment of the tech companies in China.

One of my friend is considering in China quitting his current job as an AI developer and go to grad school in the US. While **1 million RMB (130k USD)** of tuition and fees seems to cost a great fortune, he deems it worthwhile because he values work-life balance and a higher package here. However, recently an employee in FaceBook commited suicide in the Menlo Park campus. It seems that working for a FLAG company should not be the end of story (pun intended).
